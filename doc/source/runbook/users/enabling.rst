Granting a user access to "IMSS ADS Documentation"
==================================================

Problem
-------

You want to give someone access to the ``IMSS ADS Docmumentation`` application in
access.caltech.

Solution
--------

Give the user the caltech_docs role
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, you need to grant the person access to ``IMSS ADS Documentation`` app.   This
is done by granting the ``caltech_docs`` role to the person in the ``Help Desk 2``.

#. Login to access.caltech.edu
#. Click on ``Help Desk 2``
#. Search for the user you want to grant ``IMSS ADS Documentation`` access to
#. Under ``Roles``, search for the ``caltech_docs`` role and check the box
#. Click ``Save``

The user should now see ``IMSS ADS Documentation`` in their list of apps, under
``IMSS Internal``.

Add permissions in the app
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :doc:`/runbook/granting` to grant privileges to the user within ``IMSS ADS
Documentation``.
