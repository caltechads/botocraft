SSM (ssm)
=========


Managers
--------

Managers work with the primary models to provide a high-level interface to the
AWS service. They are responsible for creating, updating, and deleting the
resources in the service, as well as any additional operations that are
available for those models.

   :show-inheritance:



Primary Models
--------------

Primary models are models that you can act on directly. They are the models that
represent resources in the AWS service, and are acted on by the managers.



.. autopydantic_model:: botocraft.services.ssm.Parameter
    :show-inheritance:
    :inherited-members:
    :exclude-members: update_forward_refs, model_extra, model_fields_set, validate, schema_json, model_rebuild, model_post_init, model_parametrized_name, model_json_schema, copy, from_orm, dict, json, schema, schema_json



Secondary Models
----------------

Secondary models are models that are used by the primary models to organize
their data. They are not acted on directly, but are used to describe the
structure of the fields in the primary models or other secondary models.




Request/Response Models
-----------------------

Request/response models are models that are used to describe the structure of
the data that is sent to and received from the AWS service. They are used by
the managers to send requests to the service and to parse the responses that
are received.

You will not often use them directly -- typically they are used by the managers
internally to send requests and parse responses -- but they are included here
for completeness, and because occasionally we return them directly to you
because they have some useful additional information.
