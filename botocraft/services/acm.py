        Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services. To

        (FQDN) in the ``DomainName`` parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in
        the ``SubjectAlternativeNames`` parameter.

        Args:
            DomainName: Fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as www.example.com, that you want to secure with an ACM
                certificate. Use an asterisk (*) to create a wildcard certificate that protects several sites in the same domain.
                For example, *.example.com protects www.example.com, site.example.com, and images.example.com.

        Keyword Args:
            ValidationMethod: The method you want to use if you are requesting a public certificate to validate that you own or
                control domain. You can `validate with DNS <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-
                dns.html>`_ or `validate with email <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html>`_.
                We recommend that you use DNS validation.
            SubjectAlternativeNames: Additional FQDNs to be included in the Subject Alternative Name extension of the ACM
                certificate. For example, add the name www.example.net to a certificate for which the ``DomainName`` field is
                www.example.com if users can reach your site by using either name. The maximum number of domain names that you can
                add to an ACM certificate is 100. However, the initial quota is 10 domain names. If you need more than 10 names, you
                must request a quota increase. For more information, see `Quotas
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html>`_.
            IdempotencyToken: Customer chosen string that can be used to distinguish between calls to ``RequestCertificate``.
                Idempotency tokens time out after one hour. Therefore, if you call ``RequestCertificate`` multiple times with the
                same idempotency token within one hour, ACM recognizes that you are requesting only one certificate and will issue
                only one. If you change the idempotency token for each call, ACM recognizes that you are requesting multiple
                certificates.
            DomainValidationOptions: The domain name that you want ACM to use to send you emails so that you can validate domain
                ownership.
            Options: You can use this parameter to specify whether to add the certificate to a certificate transparency log and
                export your certificate.
            CertificateAuthorityArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private certificate authority (CA) that will be used
                to issue the certificate. If you do not provide an ARN and you are trying to request a private certificate, ACM will
                attempt to issue a public certificate. For more information about private CAs, see the `Amazon Web Services Private
                Certificate Authority <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html>`_ user guide. The ARN
                must have the following form:
            Tags: One or more resource tags to associate with the certificate.
            KeyAlgorithm: Specifies the algorithm of the public and private key pair that your certificate uses to encrypt data.
                RSA is the default key algorithm for ACM certificates. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys are
                smaller, offering security comparable to RSA keys but with greater computing efficiency. However, ECDSA is not
                supported by all network clients. Some Amazon Web Services services may require RSA keys, or only support ECDSA keys
                of a particular size, while others allow the use of either RSA and ECDSA keys to ensure that compatibility is not
                broken. Check the requirements for the Amazon Web Services service where you plan to deploy your certificate. For
                more information about selecting an algorithm, see `Key algorithms
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm- certificate.html#algorithms>`_.
